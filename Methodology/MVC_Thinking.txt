	modal和view的 ***粒度*** 的确定
	modal和view的绑定 （数据和模板的绑定)
	就需要好好设计

## Modal
> The model is the object that represents the data in the program. It manages the data and conducts all transformations on that data. 
The model has no specific knowledge of either its controllers or its views -- it contains no internal references to either. 
Rather, the system itself takes on the responsibility of maintaining links between the model and its views and notifying the views 
when the model changes.

## View
> The view is the object that manages the visual display of the data represented by the model. It produces the visual representation of 
the model object and displays the data to the user. It interacts with the model via a reference to the model object itself.

## Controller
> The controller is the object that provides the means for user interaction with the data represented by the model. 
It provides the means by which changes are made, either to the information in the model or to the appearance of the view. 
It interacts with the model via a reference to the model object itself.
